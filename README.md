# nlp-hw4

This repo contains code for A4 of Natural Language Processing. The assignment is to apply the Viterbi algorithm to decode sentences via maximum likelihood of a given language model.

## System Requirements

`A4_p1.ipynb` is a Python 3 notebook that depends on `numpy`.

## Instructions

Run the notebook from start to finish to see the implementation of the Viterbi algorithm and the construction of the score function used to equate Viterbi to maximum likelihood decoding. The write-up answering questions from A4 can be found in `writeup.pdf`.
